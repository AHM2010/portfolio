      "A responsive storefront with product discovery, filtering, cart management, and a focused checkout journey.",
    overview:
      "Electro is a front-end e-commerce application for browsing products and managing a shopping cart across screen sizes.",
    problem:
      "Product-heavy interfaces can become difficult to scan, especially when search, filters, and cart actions compete for attention.",
    solution:
      "The interface separates product discovery from cart actions and uses reusable React components to keep the browsing flow consistent.",
    learned:
      "This project strengthened my understanding of React component composition, shared state, and responsive utility-first styling.",
    challenges:
      "Keeping product filtering and cart state predictable while maintaining a clear layout on smaller screens.",
    future:
      "Add automated tests, stronger empty and error states, and a backend-powered checkout flow.",
