  {
    title: "Electro E-commerce",
    description: "A responsive storefront with product discovery, filtering, cart management, and a focused checkout journey.",
    overview: "Electro is a front-end e-commerce application for browsing products and managing a shopping cart across screen sizes.",
    problem: "Product-heavy interfaces can become difficult to scan, especially when search, filters, and cart actions compete for attention.",
    solution: "The interface separates product discovery from cart actions and uses reusable React components to keep the browsing flow consistent.",
    learned: "This project strengthened my understanding of React component composition, shared state, and responsive utility-first styling.",
    challenges: "Keeping product filtering and cart state predictable while maintaining a clear layout on smaller screens.",
    future: "Add automated tests, stronger empty and error states, and a backend-powered checkout flow.",
    image: "/images/electro-app-screen.png",
    technologies: ["React", "Vite", "Tailwind CSS", "JavaScript"],
    categories: ["React", "Tailwind", "Frontend"],
    features: ["Product search", "Smart filters", "Cart management", "Responsive checkout"],
    liveUrl: "https://electro-one.vercel.app/",
  },
  {
    title: "Dahab Desserts",
    description: "A polished, mobile-first digital menu that makes categories easy to browse and ordering easy to start.",
    overview: "A single-page restaurant menu created for customers to browse dessert categories and move quickly toward ordering.",
    problem: "Long digital menus become tiring to navigate when every item appears in one continuous list.",
    solution: "Category filtering, a responsive grid, and a prominent delivery action reduce the steps between browsing and ordering.",
    learned: "I practiced translating a real client need into a focused interface and improving layout behavior across devices.",
    challenges: "Balancing decorative restaurant branding with readable menu content and touch-friendly controls.",
    future: "Add structured menu data, availability states, and a lightweight content-management workflow.",
    image: "/images/dahab-menu-screen.png",
    technologies: ["HTML", "CSS Grid", "JavaScript"],
    categories: ["Frontend"],
    features: ["Category filtering", "Responsive menu", "Delivery CTA"],
    liveUrl: "https://ahm2010.github.io/Dahab-Desserts/",
  },
  {
    title: "Task List",
    description: "A focused daily task manager with a simple interaction model and local progress persistence.",
    overview: "A small browser-based tool for adding, completing, and removing everyday tasks.",
    problem: "A useful task list needs to remain fast and understandable while preserving progress after a refresh.",
    solution: "A compact interface and browser storage keep the workflow immediate without requiring an account or backend.",
    learned: "I gained practical experience with DOM events, data persistence, and keeping UI state synchronized with stored data.",
    challenges: "Handling task updates consistently after create, complete, and delete actions.",
    future: "Add task editing, filters, due dates, keyboard shortcuts, and automated behavior tests.",
    image: "/images/to-do-list-app-screen.png",
    technologies: ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "Local Storage"],
    categories: ["Frontend"],

  {
    title: "Advice Me",
    description: "A lightweight React experience that serves useful prompts through a clean and playful interface.",
    overview: "A focused React application that requests and presents random advice through a minimal interface.",
    problem: "Even a simple API-based experience needs clear loading behavior and an obvious way to request new content.",
    solution: "The app keeps a single primary action and gives the returned advice visual priority.",
    learned: "This project helped me practice React state, asynchronous requests, and user feedback around remote data.",
    challenges: "Keeping the interface responsive while accounting for the delay and uncertainty of an external API.",
    future: "Add retry feedback, saved advice, sharing options, and automated accessibility checks.",
    image: "/images/advice-me-screen.png",
    technologies: ["React", "JavaScript", "REST API"],
    categories: ["React", "Frontend"],
    features: ["API integration", "Loading feedback", "Accessible controls"],
